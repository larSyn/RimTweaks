# RimTweaks
RimTweaks is a collection of quality of life patches and additions.  The goal was to reduce some of the mod clutter that was piling up in my list.  I started with a few quality of life changes and, as I read through more of the code and played the game more, I started to make changes here and there.   Bulk recipes were added for stone blocks and smelting slag.  Research and a recipe was added for Glitterworld Medicine.  Cutting Stone blocks skill was returned to Crafting.  Power use was reduced in a lot of things after I got sick of spamming solar panels and batteries everywhere.  Facilities were altered.  Recipes changed.  Things that didn't make sense were fixed (for example, eating human meat was more traumatizing then eating a corpse...not sure about you, but I'd freak out more knawing on a leg than eating a slice of buttcheek).  Some of the changes make the game a little easier, others make it more challenging.  Raids are increased a bit, as are manhunter packs.
